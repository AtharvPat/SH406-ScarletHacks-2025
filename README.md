# SUNWISE  
Sunwise is a web application that predicts the average solar energy received in a given area and visualizes it through interactive graphics. By inputting an address, available rooftop area, and monthly electricity bill, users can understand their solar potential and sustainability impactâ€”helping them make informed decisions toward a greener future.
